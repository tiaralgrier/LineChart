# Preparation Data
The first step was to load all data from the [def_area_2004_2019.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation). This data didn't have any missing values or abnormalities, so it was ready be to processed and analyzed.

# Line Chart
As part of a (pretend) environmental research team, the Petrichor lab, our team’s goal was to create data visualizations that help people better understand the degradation of the Brazilian Amazon Rainforest. These sites, identified by the team, vary widely in their level of decline.</br></br>
